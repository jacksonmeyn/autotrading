#+TITLE: Auto trader

This is a simple automatic trade program.
It has 2 goals,
automatic balancing of the portfolio after certain intervals,
and automatically investing deposited money.

For example we specify a ration of 50% bonds, 50% shares.
Then the program will divide the wealth into that, then after for example a
month a deposit is made but the value of the shares and bonds has also
changed, so the program will find a way of re-balancing.

* Stretch goals
A stretch goal is to include a mechanism for finding valued and undervalued
shares automatically.
Then deciding the sell and buy based upon that information.
To do this we need to know the dividend that is payed over time.

A super stretch goal is to use machine learning to make advanced predictions
about the stock markets.
